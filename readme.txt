EEG TMS GUI v 0.01

This python script is intended to allow simultaneous TMS stimulation and EEG recording. It is designed to interface with BrainVision Recorder.  It passes the data through python, where it is then consolidated into a CSV output file that contains the montage and an array of the data.

Currently, the software assumes that you are using a 32-electrode array.  Future versions will be more flexible.

This software was developed by Steven Pillen as part of the Cortical and Cognitive Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Washington.
